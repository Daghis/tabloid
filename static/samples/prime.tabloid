    Prime Number Checker (Optimized with sqrt)

    This program prompts the user for a number and determines
    whether it is prime using a recursive algorithm.

    Algorithm:
    - Numbers less than 2 are not prime
    - For other numbers, check divisors from floor(sqrt(n)) down to 2
    - Optimization: No factor greater than sqrt(n) exists (except n itself)

    Uses Newton's method to compute square root approximation.
THAT'S THE RUMOR

    Helper function: Compute square root using Newton's method

    Newton's method iteratively refines an initial guess:
    newGuess = (guess + n/guess) / 2

    Parameters:
    - n: number to find square root of
    - guess: current approximation
    - iterations: number of refinement steps remaining

    Returns: approximate square root of n

    Helper function: Return the floor (greatest integer less than or equal to x)

    Uses the modulo operator to extract the fractional part,
    then subtracts it from x to get the integer part.

    Parameters:
    - x: number to floor

    Returns: floor(x)

    Examples:
    - floor(10.05) returns 10
    - floor(11.0) returns 11
    - floor(1.73) returns 1

    Recursive helper function to check divisors

    Checks if any number from 'divisor' down to 'minDivisor' divides n evenly.
    Uses recursion to test each potential divisor.

    Parameters:
    - n: number being tested for primality
    - divisor: current divisor to test
    - minDivisor: smallest divisor to check (stops when divisor < minDivisor)

    Returns:
    - TOTALLY RIGHT if no divisors found (n is prime)
    - COMPLETELY WRONG if a divisor is found (n is not prime)

    Main prime checking function with sqrt optimization

    Instead of checking all divisors from 2 to n-1, we only check
    up to sqrt(n). This works because if n = a * b and a <= b,
    then a <= sqrt(n) <= b. So every composite number has at least
    one factor <= sqrt(n).

    Parameters:
    - n: number to test for primality

    Returns:
    - TOTALLY RIGHT if n is prime
    - COMPLETELY WRONG if n is not prime
THAT'S THE RUMOR
